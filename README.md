**Thought Experiment: Evolution of Chirality in Biological Systems and Organisms.**  
***Author: Siddhant Sharma*** :pencil: :bulb:

This is a very deep philosophical conundrum, to answer it we would need to know how life originated from non-living chemical precursors.

Many compounds produced by living organisms are chiral, this is because they are manufactured by enzyme systems, which are large protein molecules having stereo chemically specific binding sites. Only one stereoisomer can fit the binding site in a way that leads to the end product.

**Of course, this begs the question of why the enzyme binding site only exists in one chiral configuration?**

In undergraduate organic chemistry courses, we are taught that both enantiomers of a chiral molecule (e.g., alanine) are equal in energy. Therefore, it is expected that all of our enzymes, sugars, etc. should be racemic (50:50 mixture). However, at some point in the timeline one enantiomer was amplified and now biology is chiral and really good at keeping it that way. Current research efforts are focused on understanding how chiral amplification occurred ( **see Donna Blackmond&#39;s work at Scripos La Jolla** ) as well as how to deracemize a racemic mixture ( **see Rob Knowles and Scott Miller&#39;s paper in Science for a recent example** ).

Also, for the same reason that practically all screws and nuts are threaded with the same chirality. (You turn the screw clockwise to screw it in, counter clockwise to unscrew it out.)

Thousands of key reactions in cells are mediated by enzymes. An enzyme typically has a nook where one or both reagent molecules fit in. If the key reagent is chiral, the cell would need two distinct enzymes, ER and EL, to process both optical isomers, one with a right-handed nook, the other with a left-handed nook.

However, enzymes are big proteins that are built from amino acids by a process that involves several other enzymes, including several RNA and DNA molecules. So, the cell would either have to build both EL and ER from right-handed amino-acids or have ER and EL be mirror images of each other. The first alternative would require two entirely different molecular structures that would have had to evolve together. The second alternative would require another dozen enzymes and RNA/DNA molecules that are able to process left-handed amino acids.

Carrying on that reasoning, we conclude that, if life made or processed equally both optical isomers of each chiral substance it would have to duplicate its genetic code and all biochemical mechanisms.

That would be the case, in particular, if plants made both D and L glucose from CO2, H2O. This choice would require more investment in RNA/DNA/enzymes for the same efficiency of solar energy capture.

Thus, it made more sense evolutionally for each organism to make and process only one of the two isomers of each chiral molecule -- except in a few cases where both isomers happen to be useful to the cell (usually for very different purposes). This decision was &quot;taken&quot; by a primitive organism at a very early stage of the evolution of life and inherited by all its descendants.

And that is also the reason why all screws and nuts have the same chirality (except for a few specialized applications). If people used both left- and right-handed screws equally, then every workshop, factory, and hardware store would need to stock both &quot;isomers&quot; of every size and kind; and screw makers would need two separate machines to make them. This example fits perfectly in the context of chiral systems.

Also, it occurs to me that on some planet somewhere, possibly this one, two completely separate sets of life forms could exist, one left and one right-handed. They couldn&#39;t interact biochemically, so they&#39;d be unable to feed on one another, until one isomer evolved a suite of racemases that would let one handedness feed on the other.

Eventually, the first mirror image to develop racemases would wipe out the other, and we would have the world much as it is today, dominated by a single handedness in all optically active biological things.
